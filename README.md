# E-Commerce Revenue & Efficiency Optimization Analysis

## 🎯 Project Goal
This 7-Day Data Analytics Project focuses on deriving actionable business intelligence from the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist. The primary objective is to answer the question:
> **"Where should the company focus its marketing budget to maximize profit quality (AOV) and overall revenue over the next quarter?"**

The solution involves balancing high-value product segments with operational efficiency constraints.

## 🔑 Key Insights & Business Recommendation (The CEO Pitch)

Based on the analysis, the recommendation is to **prioritize high-Average Order Value (AOV) segments** to maximize profit per transaction.

| Insight | Recommendation | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High AOV Opportunity** | Reallocate budget to segments with exceptionally high AOV, specifically **`relogios_presentes`** (Watches/Gifts). | Faster increase in overall profit quality and higher ROI per marketing dollar. |
| **Operational Risk** | Geo-target marketing efforts only to states with **below-average delivery times** (high efficiency). | Reduces the risk of customer churn and costly service issues, protecting brand value. |

## 🛠️ Tools and Techniques Featured

| Tool / Language | Purpose in Project |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Python (Pandas/NumPy)** | Data cleaning, merging multiple files into a master analytical table, feature engineering (calculating Delivery Time), and advanced KPI aggregation (`.groupby()`). |
| **Power BI** | Final dashboard visualization, creating the Scatter Plot (Revenue vs. Volume sized by AOV), and illustrating operational constraints (Map Visual). |
| **SQL (Conceptual)** | Demonstrated proficiency in aggregation logic using SQL syntax (as planned for Day 3). |
| **Git/GitHub** | Version control and portfolio hosting. |
